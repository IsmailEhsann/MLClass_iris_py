# Iris Data Classification using Python

This project is a Machine Learning classification task using the Iris dataset. I have use visualisation tools which provide insights into the data and help identify patterns that may be useful for further analysis or model building, before applying Machine Learning models.

The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*), with four features each:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Tools and Methods

This project uses the following methods and tools:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression
- K-Neighbors Classifier
